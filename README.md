# slackbot-clj

A Slackbot written in Clojure.

## Getting Started

### With Docker

Bring your database up to date, then start the Slackbot and `nginx`
reverse proxy:

```bash
docker-compose up --build migrate
docker-compose up --build -d slackbot
docker-compose up -d nginx
```

### For Development

You can start a REPL with `lein repl` and start the web-server with
`(reset)` once the REPL is started.

## Features

 * Give people or things _karma_ points using simple `++` or `--` 
   suffixes: `zelda++` or `jerry--`

 * Play Stinky Pinky with your friends or colleagues using `/sp`
